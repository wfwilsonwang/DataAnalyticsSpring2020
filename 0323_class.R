# The columns of the data set contain the four variables. 
names(USArrests )

# We first briefly examine the data. We notice that the variables have vastly different means.
# Note that the apply() function allows us to apply a function—in this case, the mean() function
# to each row or column of the data set.
# The second input here denotes whether we wish to compute the mean of the rows, 1, or the columns, 2.
# We see that there are on average three times as many rapes as murders, #and more than eight times as many assaults as rapes.
apply(USArrests , 2, mean) # 2 = column
# We can also examine the variances of the four variables using the apply() function.
apply(USArrests , 2, var)

# Not surprisingly, the variables also have vastly different variances: the UrbanPop variable measures the percentage of the population
# in each state living in an urban area, which is not a comparable number to the number of rapes in each state per 100,000 individuals.
# If we failed to scale the variables before performing PCA,
# then most of the principal components that we observed would be driven by the Assault variable,
# since it has by far the largest mean and variance. Thus, it is important to standardize the variables to have mean zero and
# standard deviation one before performing PCA.


# We now perform principal components analysis using the prcomp() function, which is one of several functions in R that perform PCA.
# By default, the prcomp() function centers the variables to have mean zero. By using the option scale=TRUE, # we scale the variables to have standard deviation one.
# The output from prcomp() contains a number of useful quantities.
pr.out=prcomp(USArrests, scale=TRUE)
names(pr.out)
# The center and scale components correspond to the means and standard deviations of the 
# variables that were used for scaling prior to implementing PCA.
pr.out$center
pr.out$scale
# The rotation matrix provides the principal component loadings; each column of pr.out$rotation contains 
# the corresponding principal component loading vector
# We see that there are four distinct principal components. 
pr.out$rotation


# Using the prcomp() function, we do not need to explicitly multiply the data by
# the principal component loading vectors in order to obtain the principal component score vectors.
# Rather the 50 × 4 matrix x has as its columns the principal component score vectors. 
# That is, the kth column is the kth principal component score vector.
dim(pr.out$x)
# We can plot the first two principal components as follows: 
biplot(pr.out, scale=0)
# The scale=0 argument to biplot() ensures that the arrows are scaled to represent the loadings;
# other values for scale give slightly different biplots with different interpretations.
# The prcomp() function also outputs the standard deviation of each principal component.
# For instance, on the USArrests data set, we can access these standard deviations as follows: 
pr.out$sdev


# The variance explained by each principal component is obtained by squaring these:
pr.var = pr.out$sdev^2 
pr.var
# To compute the propotion of variance explained by each principal component, we simply
# devide the variance explained by each principal component by the total variance explained
# by all four principal components.
pve = pr.var/sum(pr.var)
pve
# We cab see the first principal component explains 62.0% of the variance in the data.
# The next principal component explains 24.74% of the variance, and so forth...
